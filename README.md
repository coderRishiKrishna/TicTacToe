##  Tic-Tac-Toe - Console Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game using Python. Two players, `R` and `K`, take turns entering a position (0 to 8) to place their mark on a 3x3 grid. The game detects wins/draw, handles invalid inputs, and supports repeated plays.

###  How to Play

- The board is represented as a 3x3 grid with positions numbered from `0` to `8`.
- Players alternate turns entering a position (0â€“8).
- Invalid or occupied inputs are rejected.
- The game ends with a win or a draw.
- Option to play again after each round.
